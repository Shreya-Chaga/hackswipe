And some fun future meets past meets dynasties at war.\n\n💡 Inspiration\nI got inspired by the idea of people forgetting who you are. Then having to risk everything to make your loved ones remember you.\n\n🔧 How it was built\nFor the first time, I used a node workflow for 95% of the content. With Freepik's new Spaces.\n\n⚡ Challenges\nThe inconsistency of the models made spreading out the shots between the video models not practical at all. Some shot images also just wouldn't work, so I had to rethink entire sequences.\n\n🏆 Accomplishments\nDiscovering ingredients in Veo 3.1 could create incredible sequences with multiple characters.\n\n📚 What we learned\nDon't overestimate the number of shots in a short movie. It makes you create more than you can fit in the time frame or that you need for the story.\n\n🚀 What's next\nEpisode 2... perhaps a full micro-drama season?",
